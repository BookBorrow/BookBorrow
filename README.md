#Welcome to the BookBorrow

Find us online at http://bookborrower.herokuapp.com/.

BookBorrow is a simple Rails app that enables you to keep track of the books you loan out to friends. Set a return date and send them an email reminder when a book is overdue.

BookBorrow features multifaceted author, title and ISBN search, with data supplied by the Google Books API.

Check out our snappy homepage, which allows you to sign up, add a book to your library and loan it to a friend -- all in one step.
